# Intrusion Detection System using MLP

## Overview
This project implements an intrusion detection system using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) trained on the NSL-KDD dataset.

## Features
- Preprocessing of NSL-KDD dataset
- Training and saving a binary classification model
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the NSL-KDD dataset.
- `src/`: Scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `model/`: Trained model file.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
